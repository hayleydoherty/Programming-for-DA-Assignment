    "Randomness refers to a lack of pattern or predictability. Individual random events are unpredictable, however the frequency of different possible outcomes following numerous events is predictable. Random number generation is the creation of a number or sequence of numbers that cannot by reasonably predicted better than by random chance [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of random number generators, true random number generators (TRNGs) and pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PRNGs produce pseudo-random numbers with the use of deterministic algorithms from some initial seed meaning that if the seed is obtained it is possible to reproduce the seemingly random numbers. The numpy.random package is a PRNG and will be discussed in detail below. Briefly, TRNGs generate random numbers from physical random processes. They require a source of entropy which is the measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature unavailable for useful work [2]; the amount of entropy is also a measure of the molecule disorder (randomness) of a system [3]. Electrical noise is a good source of entropy for TRNGs due to the unpredictability of white noise. As there is no seed which can be used to determine the random numbers, TRNGs can guarantee a high level of security and play an important role in information communications and cryptography [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the numpy.random package is a PRNG which generates seemingly random but still reproducible numbers. It is Python's most widely used tool for generating random data. Until recently, this package used an algorithm called Marsenne Twister to generate pseudo-random data; PCG64 is now used in the latest version of the numpy package."
