### Investigation into the numpy.random package

The aim of this assignment is to investigate the NumPy.random package, specifically the aspects laid out in the assignment instructions which related to specific functions and distributions in the package, how it uses seeds to generate pseudo-random numbers as well as the overall use of the package.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook in which is my assignment. 
The notebook contains the main body of work as well as references to other work I consulted while researching the assignment.

The notebook was designed to be read from top to bottom with the first code cell to be run first as this contains the libraries and functions that must be imported for the remaining cells to run correctly.
Some code cells included in the notebook purposefully output an error, included as examples of when the NumPy.random package may not work as expected. Due to this, the cells following the error message have to be run separately as Jupyter stops running the cells when it encounters an error.
